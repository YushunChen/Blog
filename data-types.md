# Data Types

## Introduction

Go is statically typed, meaning variables always have a specific type and that type cannot change.

Data Type for a variable defines:

* The amount of memory space allocated for variables.
* A data type specifies the possible values for variables.
* The operations that can be performed on variables.

Go built-in data types:

* Numbers
* Boolean 
* String
